PCB outline is done using a vernier and a very sloppy hand, thus take it as a grain of salt till I can test the design.
Feel free to download the DXF files and edit the design to your liking.
AGAIN, I have NOT tested the design, so if you want to get it manufactured before that, it it all on YOU.
Lastly, THE CASE IS DESIGED FOR 3MM THICK ACRYLIC. Any other thickness and you will have issues with fitting of pieces together and height unless you edit it for other thickness.

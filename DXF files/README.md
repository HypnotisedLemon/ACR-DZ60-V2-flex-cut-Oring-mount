PCB outline is done using a vernier and a very sloppy hand, thus take it as a grain of salt till I can test the design.<br />
Feel free to download the DXF files and edit the design to your liking.<br />
AGAIN, I have NOT tested the design, so if you want to get it manufactured before that, it it all on YOU.<br />

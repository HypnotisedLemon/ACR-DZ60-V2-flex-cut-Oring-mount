# ACR-DZ60-V2-flex-cut-Oring-mount
Stacked acrylic case for [DZ60 V2 flex cut](https://kbdfans.com/products/dz60-60-pcb?variant=39766150316171) PCB with Oring/gummy Oring mount.
This case was inspired by my cheapskate self and curiosity to tinker around with designs.
V1, aka the current state of the design is in very early stage. Once manufactured and tested, I will update it accordingly.
If you decide to go with the design before I can test it, do it on your own risk. Me no take responsibility for any mishaps.
Lastly, THE CASE IS DESIGED FOR 3MM THICK ACRYLIC. Any other thickness and you will have issues with fitting of pieces together and height unless you edit it for thickness of your choice.
